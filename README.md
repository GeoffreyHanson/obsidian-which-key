Which-key provides direct access to all of Obsidian's commands through a sequence of keystrokes, each stroke displaying a menu of potential commands from the current key pressed.

If Vim mode is enabled, which-key emulates spacemacs/vim by triggering when Space is pressed. Activation can also be set to a hotkey.

## Installation

Which-key is currently in beta. Either clone this repository or download it as a zip file and extract it into the `.obsidian/plugins` folder of the desired vault.
